#Problem We solved
The traditional EHR system has the following flaws:
❌ Data Privacy & Security Risks – Centralized databases are vulnerable to hacking, risking sensitive patient information.
❌ Lack of Patient Ownership – Patients have no full control over their health data, relying on institutions for access.
❌ Interoperability Issues – Incompatible hospital systems prevent seamless data exchange.
❌ Data Integrity & Authenticity – Medical records can be tampered with or lost due to technical failures or attacks.
