A blockchain-powered, decentralized EHR system that ensures:<br>
✅ Data security via immutability and encryption.<br>
✅ Patient ownership & control over records using self-sovereign identity (SSI).<br>
✅ Smart contracts for seamless and permissioned data sharing.<br>
✅ Interoperability through standardized blockchain protocols.<br>
✅ Tamper-proof records ensure trust and authenticity in medical data.<br>


## 🛠 Skills
Smart Contract, Vyper, IPFS, Django, ethers.js

#Problem We solved
The traditional EHR system has the following flaws:<br>
❌ Data Privacy & Security Risks – Centralized databases are vulnerable to hacking, risking sensitive patient information.<br>
❌ Lack of Patient Ownership – Patients have no full control over their health data, relying on institutions for access.<br>
❌ Interoperability Issues – Incompatible hospital systems prevent seamless data exchange.<br>
❌ Data Integrity & Authenticity – Medical records can be tampered with or lost due to technical failures or attacks.<br>
